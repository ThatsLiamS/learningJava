# Spotify Prototype GUI and Backend

## Introduction
This project is a prototype of a Spotify-like application, allowing users to manage their song library. Users can create, search, sort, edit, and delete song records with various attributes. The implementation is done in Java using the Swing library for the GUI.


## Features
- Create new song records with basic attributes.
- Search and Sort songs based on various attributes.
- Edit and Delete existing song records.
- Import and Export encrypted records.


## Running Tests
We'll ensure the reliability of our Spotify prototype by using JUnit for unit tests. JUnit is a Java testing framework that helps verify individual parts of our code. To run tests, we'll annotate our test methods with @Test and execute them. This automates the testing process, quickly spotting any issues in our code and enhancing the overall stability and quality of our application.
